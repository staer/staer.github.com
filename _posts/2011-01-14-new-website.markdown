title: New Year, New Website
---

And here we are again, a new year, a new website. I have always been terrible 
about keeping my website up to date so this year I have tried to simplify things
a bit. For starters I have ditched my old [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com)-powered 
website which, while fun to build, can be a bit annoying to maintain. I had to 
keep up with the code, the hosting, backups, and content. 

Since I have been moving more and more of my personal code to 
[GitHub](http://github.com/staer/), I figured that I should try out 
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and the 
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) Pages 
for my website. After about 24 hours I can 
say that I'm pretty happy with [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) and the 
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) website engine. The thing that I 
like the most is that all of the posts are version controlled on 
GitHub itself, No mucking around with a database or taking backups... very nice.

Eventually I plan on building a feed aggregator which will combine my Twitter, 
GitHub, and other feeds into one convenient location. We'll see if I can do this
using nothing but JavaScript. Such is the price paid for hosting the site on 
GitHub pages which doesn't provide much in the way of server side programming.
I also wanted to give a shout out to [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/), 
very cool foundation for starting out a HTML5 site (oh yeah, giving HTML5 a try here).
